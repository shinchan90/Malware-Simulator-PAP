Thew, glad that's over.#audio=AdwareRemoval4
Take this as a lesson. Never download anything from the internet that seems way to good to be true.#audio=AdwareRemoval5

Just so you know, sometimes just deleting the malware from the system won't work, as it might leave remnants behind! #audio=AdwareRemoval7
So please always be cautious when downloading things!#audio=AdwareRemoval8
